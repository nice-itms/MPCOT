# NiCE MP Catalog Offline Toolkit (MPCOT)
 
The **NiCE MP Catalog Offline Toolkit (MPCOT)** is a tool designed to enable the use of the [Microsoft MP Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/management-pack-list?view=sc-om-2025) with _System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)_ installations in environments without internet access. This toolkit ensures that your SCOM setup remains up-to-date and efficient, even in offline scenarios.
 
## Key Features and Use Cases

- **Offline Support**: Utilize the Microsoft MP Catalog with your SCOM installation without requiring an internet connection.

- **Version Comparison**: Compare the list of imported Management Packs (MPs) in your Management Group (MG) with the most recent versions available for download from Microsoft.

- **Efficient Updates**: Download updated MPs to a system with internet connectivity. Those can be used to ensure your SCOM environment is always equipped with the latest enhancements and fixes.

- **Stay in Control**: Even if you could use the online catalog (for systems with internet access) this tool can help you stay in control. Use the `Version Comparison` feature and then decide what to update.
 
The **NiCE MP Catalog Offline Toolkit** streamlines the process of maintaining and updating your SCOM environment, providing a seamless and reliable solution for offline operations.
